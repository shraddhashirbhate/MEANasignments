File Systems
----------------
*	Read a file using NodeJs
	There are 2 methods available to do this:

		1) fs.readFile (path [, options] , calllback)

		*   It has three parameters
		*   It is non-blocking method due to the use of Callback function.
		*   It is difficult to understand but performance is very good (If u want to 
		     read excel, etc)
		*   Difficult to understand the flow
		*   Exception Handling becomes even more difficult.
		*   But then why it is usefull ? 
			Beacuse due to callBack function, nodeJs becomes more powerful.
			Almost all the functions becomes asynchronous.


		2) fs.readFileSync (path [, options])

		*   It has 2 parameters.
		*   It is a Blocking Method
		*   It is easy to understand but performance is very poor. 

*	Non-blocking nature of the program is always good.
	therefore, fs.readFile method is always preffered over 	 fs.readFileSync.


*	npm install is helping us to install external module.

*	Promise will help us to execite things one aftre another.
	there are multiple aynchronous functions that we want execute in a sequential manner.
	
*	bluebird is helping us to acheive such tasks with the help of promises.

*  	we want asynchronous but avoiding callback.
	this thing is getting improved with the help of bluebird.
